# ALMS Security Model (proposed)

ALMS will run **autonomous agents** that can (sometimes) execute tools with real impact: shell commands, file writes, network calls, scheduling jobs, spawning subagents.

This document defines a security model that makes those capabilities:
- **explicit** (capabilities and scopes)
- **auditable** (append-only log)
- **revocable** (grants expire)
- **bounded** (resource limits, sandboxes)

> Goal: ALMS should feel powerful like OpenClaw, but be designed so “power” doesn’t mean “unsafe by default”.

## 0) Threat model (what we’re defending against)

### Accidental harm
- Agents running the wrong shell command
- Overwriting files, deleting data
- Infinite loops / runaway costs
- Cronjobs that keep firing unexpectedly

### Malicious inputs
- Prompt injection via web content / user messages
- Tool output injection (LLM reads tool output and gets manipulated)
- Untrusted plugins/tools

### System risks
- Secrets exfiltration (SSH keys, tokens)
- Lateral movement (LAN scanning)
- Persistence via cronjobs / startup scripts

---

## 1) Core concepts

### 1.1 Principals
Everything is authorized relative to a **principal**:
- user identity (e.g., Telegram user id, local OS user)
- agent identity (main agent id, subagent id)
- job identity (cron job id)

### 1.2 Capabilities
Capabilities are **named permissions**. Keep them few and composable.

Example capability set (v1):
- `fs.read`, `fs.write`
- `shell.exec`
- `net.http`, `net.dns`
- `git.exec`
- `process.spawn`
- `jobs.create`, `jobs.run`, `jobs.modify`
- `agents.spawn_subagent`
- `secrets.read` (special: should be rare)

> Important: unify to **one capability model** across coordinator/runtime/tools.

### 1.3 Scopes
Every capability grant should have a **scope**, not just “allowed/denied”.

Scope dimensions:
- **resource scope**
  - filesystem: path prefixes (workspace-only vs full-disk)
  - network: allowlist domains / CIDRs
  - shell: allowlist commands or denylist patterns
- **time scope**: expires_at / TTL
- **rate limits**: per minute / per job run
- **context scope**: which session/job can use it

### 1.4 Policy engine
A simple, explicit policy evaluation function:

```
allow?(principal, capability, scope, request) -> decision
```

Decision includes:
- allow / deny
- allow-with-approval
- redacted output (for secrets)

Keep policy deterministic and testable.

---

## 2) Approval model (human-in-the-loop)

ALMS should support multiple security postures.

### Modes
- **Safe (default)**: destructive or broad actions require approval
- **Developer**: approvals off or reduced (local dev only)
- **Locked-down**: most tools disabled, allowlist-only

### When to require approval (recommended)
- `shell.exec` outside workspace
- `fs.write` outside workspace
- any `rm`, `chmod`, `chown`, `sudo`, package installs
- network calls to non-allowlisted domains
- creating/modifying cronjobs
- reading secrets

### Approval UI/UX
Approvals must show:
- exact command / action
- cwd + env notes
- files affected (best effort)
- why the agent wants it (LLM-provided explanation)
- “allow once” vs “allow for session” vs “allow always (rule)”

---

## 3) Tool execution security

### 3.1 Tool interface
Tools should have:
- input JSON schema (validation)
- output schema (optional)
- declared required capabilities
- declared risk level

### 3.2 Resource limits
Per tool invocation:
- timeout
- memory cap
- output size cap
- concurrency cap

### 3.3 Output handling / injection resistance
Tool output is untrusted input to the model.

Mitigations:
- wrap tool outputs with clear delimiters
- strip/escape control sequences
- for web fetches: reduce to extracted text, no scripts
- optionally run a “tool-output sanitizer” step

---

## 4) Shell access model (do this carefully)

### 4.1 Do not expose raw bash as a default
Expose a `shell_exec` tool that is policy-gated.

### 4.2 Minimal contract for `shell_exec`
Request fields:
- `cmd`: array of strings (no shell interpolation), e.g. `["git","status"]`
- `cwd`: workspace-relative path
- `timeout_ms`
- `env`: allowlist keys only

Response fields:
- `exit_code`
- `stdout` (truncated)
- `stderr` (truncated)
- `duration_ms`

### 4.3 Workspace sandboxing
- Default cwd is workspace
- Disallow `..` escapes unless explicitly permitted
- Optional: per-session temp workspace

### 4.4 Isolation roadmap
- MVP: `Command` + strict limits
- Next: `bubblewrap`/`nsjail`/containers for the tool process
- Later: microVMs for high-risk environments

---

## 5) WASM tool security

### 5.1 Why WASM
- reduces risk of arbitrary native code execution
- enforces memory safety and offers deterministic metering

### 5.2 Still not a complete sandbox
If WASM tools can call host functions, the host must enforce:
- capability checks on every host call
- bounds checks and rate limits

### 5.3 ABI requirements
Define one stable ABI:
- how params are passed
- how results are returned
- how tools allocate memory
- error semantics

---

## 6) Cronjobs / autonomy safety

Cron = persistence. Treat it as privileged.

Rules:
- Creating/modifying jobs should usually require approval.
- Jobs run with a dedicated principal: `job:<id>`
- Jobs inherit only the minimum capabilities required.
- Every run is recorded with full audit trail.

Job safety:
- max runtime per run
- max concurrency per job
- backoff on repeated failures
- easy kill switch (`disable job`)

---

## 7) Session state + secrets

### Secrets handling
- Never store secrets in plain text transcripts.
- Use a dedicated secrets store (later) or environment-injected secrets.
- Tool outputs that include secrets should be redacted before storing.

### Transcript privacy
- Separate “user-visible messages” from “internal debug traces”.
- Allow disabling debug traces in production.

---

## 8) Audit logging (non-negotiable)

Every sensitive action must be append-only logged:
- who requested it (principal)
- what was attempted
- what was executed
- result + exit code
- time + duration
- related session/run IDs

Suggested table/event fields:
- `event_id`, `ts`, `principal`, `session_id`, `run_id`
- `capability`, `scope`, `action_type`
- `request_json`, `result_json`
- `decision` (allow/deny/approved)

---

## 9) Secure defaults (v1)

Default posture recommendations:
- Workspace-only file access
- No `sudo`
- Network allowlist empty by default (or OpenAI/OpenRouter only)
- Cronjob creation requires approval
- Shell commands must be argv array, not raw shell
- Strict output truncation

---

## 10) Implementation checklist

P0 (before public use):
- [ ] Single capability model, used everywhere
- [ ] Tool registry enforces capability checks
- [ ] Shell tool uses argv (no `bash -lc` by default)
- [ ] Audit log for tool runs + job runs
- [ ] Job principal + capability scoping
- [ ] Output truncation + sanitization

P1:
- [ ] Container/jail execution for shell tools
- [ ] Secrets store + redaction
- [ ] Per-domain network allowlists

P2:
- [ ] MicroVM execution for high-risk tools
- [ ] Signed tool/plugin bundles
